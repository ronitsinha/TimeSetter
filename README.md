#Python Date and Time Setter
Just a simple program to set windows date and time from [just-the-time](http://just-the-time.appspot.com/) using pywin32. I made after I installed Ubuntu on my computer alongside Windows. Upon doing this, I noticed the time in Windows would become offset when I booted into Windows after using Ubuntu.
